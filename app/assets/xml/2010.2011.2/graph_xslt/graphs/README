Note: $answers can be specified in two formats.

The first format is raw tally data, where a <q> element looks like this:
	<q id="conc"><a>C</a><a>C</a><a>N</a><a>C</a><a>D</a><a>N</a><a>N</a></q>
(i.e. there is a separate <a> element for each individual response, and the <a> element)
contains the answer ID as string content)

The second format is tally summary data, where a <q> element looks like this:
	<q id="conc"><a id="C">3</a><a id="N">3</a><a id="D">1</a></q>
(i.e. there is one <a> element for each possible answer ID, and the content is the number
of people who responded with that answer ID)

Therefore, when we need to count how many people answered a given way, we need to take
into account both formats, like this:

	count($answers[not(@id) and string() = $desired_id]) + sum($answers[@id = $desired_id])

First we count the number of <a> elements with no ID attribute having the desired answer ID
as their string content (format 1).

Then we add the value of the <a> element with the desired answer ID in its ID attribute (format 2).
(Although there's only one such <a> element, we use sum() because sum() won't return NaN if there
happens to not be any <a> elements with the desired answer ID.)
