  <h3>Funny Quotes</h3>
  <p>
  	<i>Our staff combs through more than 10,000 surveys every semester and the vast majority of
  	the student comments are serious, honest, and constructive, written with the best of intentions,
  	and of course we treat them as such. Occasionally, however, we come across some particularly amusing
  	comments, and here we present them. In accordance with our long-standing policy, we have deleted any
  	specific references and names. Enjoy!</i>
