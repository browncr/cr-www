  <h3>History of the Critical Review</h3>

  <p><q>There is an invisible line eighteen inches ahead of the front
  row in far too many classes at Brown: the instructor is on one side,
  the students on the other. Information flows from front to back,
  and rarely the other way. Both students and instructors must make
  a conscious effort to erase this line, for teaching and learning to
  be most effective.</q></p>

  <h4>The First Decade: Format and Process</h4>

  <p>In 1976, just seven years after Brown's New Curriculum had been
  announced, The Other View: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown
  was started by a group of Brown undergraduates as a publication of
  the Undergraduate Council of Students. In this annual magazine,
  students wrote reviews of courses based on responses to both the
  organization's own questionnaires and also based on departmental
  questionnaires which were made available by several departments. The
  written evaluations were short, and the numerical ratings sections,
  when presented, consisted of only averages. Department Undergraduate
  Groups were essential to the process because they distributed and
  collected questionnaires from classes and helped to develop customized
  questionnaires for their respective departments.</p>

  <p>There was no set process for putting the magazine together, and
  since the questionnaires were different for different classes, the
  course summaries varied significantly in terms of what information
  they presented and emphasized. "There must be a better way than
  having three people slave over questionnaires in the UCS office
  for two summer months," wrote the editors on the cover page of one
  of the first editions, "A more rational, uniform process must be
  developed." Sometime between 1978 and 1981, the name was changed
  to The Critical Review: A Consumer's Guide to Courses at Brown. The
  number of courses reviewed in each edition varied considerably from
  year to year. The editors changed the procedure for compiling the
  magazine annually.</p>

  <p>In 1984, recently appointed Editor-in-Chief Rob Markey sought
  feedback from students and faculty and then overhauled the system in
  time to create a 1985-1986 Semester I edition, the first issue of the
  Critical Review to cover a single semester. The editors introduced the
  now standard two-reviews-per-page format, with bar graphs, which were
  meant to depict the general distribution of student responses. The
  bar graphs were implemented in order to improve the accountability of
  the Critical Review by balancing the written summaries with objective
  data from the student surveys and by presenting sample sizes, so that
  professors would know the reviews were not based on the comments
  of just one or two students. The editors also created customized
  software to make it easy to produce the bar graphs. However, at this
  point the Critical Review still relied on departmental evaluations,
  so bar graphs were not available for many classes. Having found
  a satisfactory and manageable system to which Brown students and
  faculty responded favorably, the editors changed relatively little
  about the format, process, and policy of the Critical Review over
  the next few years.</p>

  <h4>The Early 1990s: Refinements</h4>

  <p>Mark Popofsky became Editor-in-Chief in 1989 and developed the bar
  graph system that the Critical Review still uses today. He established
  new policy for the organization which created lasting precedent:
  "Because we solely represent student opinion, the Critical Review
  no longer prints any department-sponsored articles and cannot use
  departmental evaluations." The editors rewrote the questionnaire
  and developed new procedure that reduced the time required for the
  production cycle. As Mark wrote, "This issue marks the culmination
  of what has been a personal crusade of mine for the past year:
  to publish the Critical Review in time for preregistration." Later
  editors said that he inspired them to make every effort to turn the
  Critical Review into a more professional-looking book.</p>

  <p>In 1991 the Critical Review began to publish "Insights from
  Student Surveys," which quickly evolved into a regular feature called
  "Funny Quotes." The level of faculty participation gradually rose
  from the 1980s to the early 1990s. The Critical Review began using
  an instructor questionnaire as well in 1992, "in order to gain
  the perspective of the faculty." A few semesters after switching
  publishers to the company TCI Press in order to print higher quality
  magazines, the number of courses reviewed reached a peak of 425 in
  the 1993-1994 Semester I edition. The Critical Review began using
  the program PageMaker to compose its page layouts at this time,
  which further improved upon the look of the book.</p>

  <p>Despite the efforts and hard work of the editors, the editions
  of the Critical Review that were published at this time were not
  flawless. The accelerated production cycle, combined with limited
  computing resources available to editors, resulted in a few editions
  of the magazine that contained significant errors. Some instructors
  stopped participating in the Critical Review because they saw it
  as unprofessional or sloppy. The gradual upward trend in the number
  of courses reviewed per semester came to a halt, and the number of
  reviews per semester gradually decreased until 1998, at which point
  it flat lined at about 280 reviews per edition.</p>

  <h4>New Questionnaire, New Purpose</h4>

  <p>Christopher Anderson joined the Critical Review around 1993
  and rapidly rose through its ranks as the computer consultant. He
  systematized many aspects of the production process when computing
  assistance was urgently needed and editors before him and after
  him identified him as a tremendous help. As editor-in-chief
  in 1995, he worked with faculty and Critical Review staff to
  perform a comprehensive analysis and revision of the organization's
  questionnaires. Despite all the help with the computer aspects that
  he offered over the years, he identified his new questionnaire as
  his greatest contribution to the Critical Review.</p>

  <p>Rebecca More, Professor of history at Brown and Director of the
  Harriet W. Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning, was one of
  the faculty members who worked with Chris on this project. "Many of
  the questions still in use today on the form date from that effort,"
  she says. "Our collective goal at that time was to develop questions
  which would be constructive and help faculty improve their teaching
  and student learning." Chris Anderson envisioned the Critical
  Review as more than just a resource for students. He saw it as a
  constructive feedback service for faculty as well, and worked toward
  that end by organizing a "teaching forum" for faculty in the spring
  of 1995. Unfortunately, the frequency with which the Critical Review
  published errors at this time prevented many instructors from taking
  a renewed interest. Nevertheless, Chris's new questionnaire was used
  from 1996 to 2001, at which point it was further modified with the
  help of faculty.</p>

  <h4>Web Site and Budget Cuts</h4>

  <p>Even as early as 1993, the editors of the Critical Review
  recognized that the organization should eventually establish a
  web-based resource. As they wrote, "The goal of putting together an
  on-line CR connected to the Brown On-line Course Announcement (BOCA)
  should be discussed." In 1997, the organization finally achieved
  that goal, thanks to its first website architect, David Tom. There
  was only marginal interest in the Critical Review's website during
  its first year of existence, however, as printed copies were still
  available for all undergraduates.</p>

  <p>Just as the website was constructed, the Undergraduate Finance
  Board decided to slice the Critical Review's annual budget from
  $25,890 to $11,490, the largest budget cut for any single student
  group that year. Facing a funding decrease themselves of more than
  $100,000 because of their reliance on diminishing holding funds,
  UFB deliberately targeted the Critical Review in order to eliminate
  its printed form.</p>

  <p>The Critical Review editors were devastated by this decision. Evan
  Snyder served as editor-in-chief for the next edition, and he outlined
  his case for the importance of a printed form of the Critical Review
  in it. He argued that with just an online format, the Critical Review
  would not be able to attract as many writers, students and faculty
  would have more limited access to it, readers would no longer be able
  to browse it leisurely, and thus it would be "virtually impossible"
  for readers to discover great courses inadvertently. He added,
  "In our hyper-frantic rush to produce this book from scratch in a
  three-week period, the last thing we wanted to be doing was fighting
  for our existence. And yet this is precisely what circumstances
  dictate we do." The editors said that faculty would probably have
  to pay for their own copies from then on, and that they would no
  longer be able to produce enough copies for every undergraduate. </p>

  <p>The Undergraduate Finance Board eventually returned most of
  the funding that it had taken away. After Evan Snyder graduated in
  2000, however, UFB cut the Critical Review's printing budget again,
  and made the cut effective immediately. With the reduced budget,
  the circulation of the next edition was 2500 copies, down from
  5500 copies three years earlier. In this edition, the editors again
  presented their argument for the importance of printed copies. "We
  asked each student who filled out a [questionnaire] to tell us whether
  she believed that the hard copy of The Critical Review should continue
  to exist, and the reply was 'yes' in overwhelming numbers [...]. But
  sadly, this view has not been that of those with the most financial
  control over the publication."</p>

  <p>Funding remained a major concern as the editors tried repeatedly
  to convince the Undergraduate Finance Board that the Critical Review
  must remain in print form. There were some gains, but after 2002,
  the Critical Review's budget increased only marginally.</p>

  <h4>Raising Standards</h4>

  <p>Interest in the publication rose after 2001. The number of courses
  reviewed per semester gradually increased. The number of Critical
  Review staff members nearly tripled from 2001 to 2004, to the point
  that for the first time in its history, the Critical Review was able to
  introduce an application process to become a writer. The organization's
  website also underwent major revisions from 2002 to 2004, and at the
  beginning of the spring 2005 semester, thousands of students visited
  it each day. Critical Review editors studied available research on
  student ratings of instruction and sought suggestions from survey
  methodology experts. Students and instructors from other colleges
  occasionally contacted the Critical Review for advice about how to
  set up equivalent services at their respective schools.</p>

  <p>In December 2004 the editors hosted a "Faculty Forum" to seek
  suggestions and feedback from instructors about Critical Review
  policy and the questionnaires themselves. Several professors who
  had not participated in the Critical Review for years began to
  participate again. The editors formally rejected the perception that
  the publication is a service to only the student body by ratifying
  a group constitution in February of 2005, outlining the objectives
  of the organization with regard to serving both students and faculty
  of Brown. After the publication of each edition, the Critical Review
  now receives numerous complaints from students and instructors about
  the shortage of printed copies. Thus far, however, the Undergraduate
  Finance Board has refused to fully fund the Critical Review.</p>
